# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show how different fundraising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals, to help Louise determine the best course of action for her own fundraising campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
To help Louise determine the best course of action for her fundraising campaign, I rendered visualizations of theater outcomes based on their launch date and outcomes based on play-specific fundraising goals.

A challenge I encountered looking at theater outcomes is that the dataset included a variety of types of fundraisers (for spaces, plays, and musicals) which could distract from Louise's play-based project. The theater outcomes data also draws from 21 different countries, which provides a greater data-set to draw from, but makes it hard to account for country-specific factors which could potentially affect a play's success (politics, climate, education resources, arts philanthropy, etc.).

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Looking at the outcomes based on launch date, it is evident that the greatest number of successful campaigns are launched in the month of May. The month of December is probably the worst time to launch a campaign as there are about as many campaigns that succeed as fail during that time of year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Looking at the outcomes based on goals, campaigns that have a goal of less than $1000 have a 76% success rate, the greatest success rate in our set. If the play is estimated to cost more than $5000, it would be my recommendation to fundraise for $35000-$45000, a bracket which demonstrated a 67% success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Limitations of this dataset include knowing any financial information about the "backers", geographic information about where these campaigns were launched (e.g., urban versus rural), and what fundraising methods were employed, each of which could help us make more informed decisions about future campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Looking at this data, it might be beneficial to create an additional column that put the goal and pledged amounts into a uniform currency exchange rate, as the data presented shows 13 different varieties of currency all being counted as if they demonstrated the same exchange rate. This wouldn't affect success or fail numbers, but it could change our numbers as far as how many campaigns fit into which goal range. Additionally, we could also present visualizations of similar analyses above, removing the "spaces" and "musicals" subcategories from our dataset, to get a better sense of how plays fare on their own. It might also be interesting to look at the duration of campaigns, to see if how long they last correlates to their success/fail rate.
